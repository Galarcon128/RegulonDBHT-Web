### Transcription Terminator Sites\n **Summary**\n This collection contains 5 datasets.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n __1. Annotation__\n Original data separated by growth conditions.\n __2. Uniformization__\n TTSs were collected from 3 curated publications, and processed to produce uniform bed-like dataset files with the following fields:\n\n - __chromosome:__ NC_000913.3\n - __start:__ Left genomic position. If not reported, will be the same as term_pos\n - __stop:__ Right genomic position. If not reported, will be the same as term_pos\n - __id:__ Unique TSS ID\n - __term_pos:__ Terminal position reported by authors\n - __strand:__ TTS strand reported by authors\n\nWhen the original data was reported to have coordinates from the NC_000913.2 version of the genome, they were converted to the latest version NC_000913.3 using the online converter provided by biocyc: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/map-seq-coords-form?chromosome=COLI-K12
