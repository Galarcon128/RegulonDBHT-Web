### Transcription Start Sites\n __Summary__\n This collection contains 15 datasets.\n\n __Creation of the collection__\n **1. Annotation**\n Original data separated by growth conditions\n\n **2. Uniformization** \n TSSs were collected from 7 curated publications, and processed to produce uniform bed-like dataset files with the following fields:\n\n - __chromosome:__ NC_000913.3\n- __start:__ Left genomic position. If not reported, will be the same as pos_1\n - __stop:__ Right genomic position. If not reported, will be the same as pos_1\n - __id:__ Unique TSS ID\n- __pos_1:__ TSS +1 position reported by authors\n- __strand:__ TSS strand reported by authors\n\n When the original data was reported to have coordinates from the NC_000913.2 version of the genome, they were converted to the latest version NC_000913.3 using the online converter provided by biocyc: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/map-seq-coords-form?chromosome=COLI-K12
